In June 2020 I created a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/shawwn) to help fund our work:

- a [collaborative tagging site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23479257) called tagpls. The data is freely available to everyone. You can use it to train models such as an [anime hand detector](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeResearch/comments/gmcdkw/help_build_an_anime_hand_detector_by_tagging/).

- an [ML community discord server](https://github.com/shawwn/tpudiepie#ml-community) with over 400 members, many of whom are talented ML researchers.

## Top Supporters

June 2020 Goal: $7 out of $50

Want to contribute? You can [support us here](https://www.patreon.com/shawwn). The more you contribute, the higher you'll appear on the wall.

1. Thank you, **goolulusaurs**! I'll always remember your support â€“ and that you were my first patron. Your name sounds cool too.
